3. other things

When a program is correct in the single session semantics,

shows "programCorrect program"

  assume steps: "initialState program ~~ trace \<leadsto>* S"
  
  text {* We can assume transactions are packed. *}

  text {* We show that the trace must be correct (proof by contradiction). *}
